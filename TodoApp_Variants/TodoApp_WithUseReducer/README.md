# TodoApp_WithUseReducer 🔄📜

This Todo app variant uses **useReducer** for managing the state of tasks. Similar to **useState**, but better suited for complex state logic. CRUD operations are handled as follows:

- **Add** a new todo item ✍️
- **Edit** tasks ✏️
- **Delete** tasks 🗑️

### Features:
- **useReducer** for managing complex state transitions.
- Better structure for handling actions in large applications.
