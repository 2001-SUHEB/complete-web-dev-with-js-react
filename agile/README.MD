# 📚 Study Material: Scrum, Kanban, and Waterfall vs Agile

---

## **📌 Scrum**

### **Definition**  
Scrum is an **Agile framework** designed for teams to work collaboratively on complex projects. It delivers functional increments in **time-boxed iterations** called **sprints**, fostering adaptability, transparency, and collaboration.

### **Key Components**  
1. **Roles**:
   - 🏗️ **Product Owner**: Manages the **product backlog** and prioritizes tasks based on business value.
   - 👩‍🔧 **Scrum Master**: Facilitates the Scrum process and removes impediments for the team.
   - 👩‍💻 **Development Team**: A cross-functional group responsible for delivering the product increment.

2. **Events**:
   - **Sprint**: A fixed iteration (2-4 weeks) to deliver a potentially shippable product increment.
   - **Sprint Planning**: A meeting to define sprint goals and select tasks from the backlog.
   - **Daily Scrum**: A daily 15-minute stand-up to synchronize team efforts.
   - **Sprint Review**: A meeting at the end of the sprint to showcase the completed work.
   - **Sprint Retrospective**: A review meeting to identify and implement process improvements.

3. **Artifacts**:
   - 📋 **Product Backlog**: A prioritized list of all features, enhancements, and bug fixes.
   - ✅ **Sprint Backlog**: Selected tasks from the product backlog for the current sprint.
   - 📦 **Increment**: The completed and potentially shippable product at the end of the sprint.

## **📌 Kanban**

### **Definition**  
Kanban is a **visual workflow management framework** that focuses on **continuous delivery** by optimizing task flow and minimizing work in progress (WIP).

### **Key Principles**  
1. **Visualize Workflow**: Tasks are managed using a **Kanban Board** with columns representing workflow stages (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done).
2. **Limit Work in Progress (WIP)**: Restricts the number of tasks in progress to prevent bottlenecks.
3. **Manage Flow**: Focuses on optimizing the flow of tasks through the workflow.
4. **Continuous Improvement**: Regularly reviews and refines the process for better efficiency.

## **📌 Waterfall vs Agile**

### **Waterfall**  
Waterfall is a **sequential development methodology** where each phase (e.g., requirements, design, development, testing) must be completed before moving to the next. It is **rigid** and best suited for projects with well-defined requirements.

#### **Key Features**:
- Phases are completed in order, with no overlap.
- Minimal client involvement after initial requirements gathering.
- Difficult to adapt to changes mid-project.

### **Agile**  
Agile is a **flexible methodology** that focuses on iterative and incremental development. Teams work in short cycles, allowing continuous feedback and adaptation.

#### **Key Features**:
- **Iterative Process**: Work is divided into small, manageable iterations.
- **Customer Collaboration**: Ongoing feedback from stakeholders.
- **Adaptability**: Changes can be incorporated at any stage.

## **📊 Comparison: Waterfall vs Agile**

| **Aspect**            | **Waterfall**                                  | **Agile**                                     |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Approach**          | Sequential                                    | Iterative and incremental                    |
| **Flexibility**       | Low                                           | High                                         |
| **Customer Involvement** | Minimal during development phases            | Continuous throughout the project            |
| **Changes**           | Difficult to accommodate                      | Easy to incorporate                          |
| **Delivery**          | Final product delivered at the end            | Frequent, small increments delivered         |
| **Best Suited For**   | Well-defined, static requirements              | Dynamic projects with changing requirements  |

## **📌 When to Use Scrum vs Kanban**

| **Aspect**            | **Scrum**                                     | **Kanban**                                   |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Iterations**        | Fixed-length sprints (2-4 weeks)             | Continuous flow                              |
| **Roles**             | Defined roles: Product Owner, Scrum Master   | No specific roles                            |
| **Flexibility**       | Scope is fixed within a sprint               | Highly flexible                              |
| **Work Limits**       | No explicit WIP limits                       | Uses WIP limits                              |
| **Best Suited For**   | Teams needing structure and deadlines         | Teams needing flexibility and flow           |

### **Summary**

- **Scrum**: Best for structured, goal-oriented development in sprints.
- **Kanban**: Ideal for optimizing flow and continuous delivery.
- **Waterfall**: Suitable for projects with static, well-defined requirements.
- **Agile**: Great for dynamic environments where adaptability is key.
